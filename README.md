# LithicTech
Technological and spatial analysis of archaeological lithic data

This is a basic way to analyze your assemblage using R. I recommend installing RStudio, as it is much easier to work with (especially if you are new to the command line).

Data Management:
I do basic data entry in Excel, which allows some flexibility based on how assemblage data was recorded (lab or field). Necessary data for each step on are then moved to a new sheet, which is exported as a .csv file. This format is appropriate for importing to R.

This example uses CSV files saved in the same folder as this project. This allows R to easily access them. Replace the given file names with your own wherever they occur.
